# Hangman - Android
A simple [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) game made in Kotlin with compose.


As a user, when I'm in a game session,
I want to see my score history,
I want to start a new game, 
I want to be challenged with unique words only, 
I want to know how many unique words I can still guess. 

As a user, when I'm playing the match,
I want to know how many chances I still have,
I want to be able to try out letters in any order I want,
I want to know how many points I made when I completed a word,
I want that my game state is persisted.

We want to see a creative code base, take your time and only deliver to us something 
you are comfortable with and represents the best state of your work.

Please use a public git repository as we want to see how you interact with git, 
hinting into frequent and clear commits.

Enjoy! ðŸ¥³
